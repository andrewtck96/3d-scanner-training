In this tutorial we are going to go through and do some simple additions to greatly improve the quality of a normal flange.

This time, lets produce an exhaust head flange from a 2d profile.
Often we can come across simple 2d profiles of exhaust flanges online lacking in dimensions but are accurate representations of the profile.

This is quite common with head exhaust flanges.

Below is an example I have found for an SR20DET flange.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled.jpeg)

We can see we have 3 major dimensions but no additional information. Using the process we learn in L1 we are going to go through and produce a model of this flange.

However this time we are going to recess the exhaust ports for our Schedule 40 steam pipe to produce a turbo manifold from.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled.png)

After importing and scale our drawing I do a quick check to ensure that our Y dimension is accurate. We can see compared to the drawing we are within 0.01mm, well without our 0.5mm tolerance. 

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%201.png)

Going through and using the perimeter circle tool, populate all the points and the 2 radii of the first port.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%202.png)

Then using the relationship bar for both circles, make the centre relationship Horizontal to each other and set the circle radii to be equal 

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%203.png)

Now draw horizontal lines between the circles and trim away the interior leaving the port profile.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%204.png)

For speed, I like to use the power trim tool and erase the excess geometry away.

Now for the trick, we are going to take this geometry and turn it into a 'Block'

A Block is a piece of 2d geometry that has locked relationships to each other within it. It can be copied, rotated and have external relations attached to it without influencing the geometry within the block.

The great thing about blocks is you can save them externally and use this in future drawings that you may use, such as a Individual Throttle Body flange shape (Silvertop/Blacktop 4age for example).

While still in the sketch go;

Tools → Blocks → Make

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%206.png)

Now select the geometry you wish to put into the block and confirm by clicking the green tick.

The geometry will now go grey and the block will appear in the feature tree.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%207.png)

Now we can select the block either in the sketch or in the feature tree and copy and past it.

I prefer to use CTRL + C, CTRL + P when doing this for ease of speed.

Note; Try to learn and use Hotkeys when possible and become comfortable with them as this will greatly increase the speed of workflow.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%208.png)

Now we are going to align our ports by selecting the center point of the arc on each block and moving it into position over our sketch.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%209.png)

A handy thing most CAD packages will do is align and set relationships to existing geometry while you are moving it. Solidworks will show you that it is doing this by 

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2010.png)

At this stage what I do, is close this sketch and work from it as a reference. 

This stops us from accidently changing any critical geometry and build information to referent from.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2011.png)

Do 2 'Slow single clicks' on the sketch, a cursor will appear and allow you to rename it from 'Sketch 1'

Creating a new sketch on the top plane, use the 'offset entity' tool to create the outter profile of our flange.

As we intend this to be a turbo flange, we will need more material than what we see as our reference geometry. This reduces warping when we are fabricating the flange. If we are to make this from stainless steel additional material also reduces cracking through the flange. Be aware though that due to cyclical heating and cooling any turbo charger manifold is prone to cracking.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2012.png)

Go through and offset around the outside of the flanges and holes.

Go through and join the profiles and add material between the ports.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2013.png)

Be cautious of anything that could interfere with the flange from the head while doing this.

Particularly when doing intake flanges, VVTI solenoids, and water outlets need to be taken into consideration whilst working through modelling.

Next we are going to use my favourite tool, Power Trim

During trimming, to make it easier to see, it is often best to hide the reference geometry.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2014.png)

This is where people branch into 2 schools of thought.

Do we fillet all the points now to ease manufacturing, or do we do it after it is a solid body?

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2015.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2016.png)

If we add fillets to the sketch at this point, if we wish to change its dimension in the future, this can alter the unintentionally destroying relationships and dimensions.

If we add the fillets to the solid body, we can easily increase and decrease this without influencing the base geometry. We also have the ability to build this into macros or use formula to drive this dimension if we wish to make this design into a product range with changing variables.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2017.png)

Extrude your flange, then add corner fillets to any sharp geometry.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2018.png)

When we consider the method for manufacture, this will influence what size this fillet needs to be. 

If we are going to laser cut this flange, 1 - 2mm is fine. However we want to CNC mill this flange so that we can put recesses into the face to match our tubes to. For this reason I would not recommend anything smaller than 6mm.

This allows the machinist to use a 10mm end mill to cut the profile with a continuous and smooth tool path.

Create a New Sketch on the top plane, now select the reference geometry. You should get a grey dotted ghost of this geo coming through your model like below.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2019.png)

Click convert entities to bring this geometry into your current sketch.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2020.png)

We now have our hole geometry that is linked to our reference geometry. If we make any changes in the Reference Geometry Sketch, this will update to our boss extrude and our holes extrude cut sketchs.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2021.png)

Extrude cut these 'through all'

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2022.png)

Lets do the recesses for our exhaust tubing.

Below is a manufacturers table for standard Schedule tubing. This is cast pipe readily available from steel merchants all over the world. 

Most turbo manifolds are made from Sch 40 tube and bends for its ability to resist heat and cracking, and its commonality.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2023.png)

We are now going to create a sketch on the top face of our flange. This is because the recess we wish to create will be subtracted in this direction from the flange material.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2024.png)

Using the line tool, create a 'center line' between the middle of each arc so we can position our recess central to our ports.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2025.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2026.png)

Next create our circles selecting the center point of our center line. Draw the circles oversize to ensure no relationships are accidentally created between existing geometry and our new circles.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2027.png)

Select all 4 circles and give them an 'equal' relationship to each other, dimension the first one to the OD of our Schedule 40 pipe size we are going to use.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2028.png)

Because the pipe is rough cast, we will need to add some clearance to this dimension to accommodate for this.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2029.png)

Adding 0.6mm in clearance on the diameter of the recess allows us to have 0.3mm variation on the thickness of the material.

Now extrude cut downward 4mm and we have our pipe recesses

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2030.png)

Add weld preps and chamfers to all the edges to spice up the design.

NOTE: Please avoid using fillets for any top surface blends if you are looking into producing a low cost part. It is timely and expensive to create this detail during the manufacturing process.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2031.png)

I will cover this in greater detail in the CNC portion of training material. 

We can also go through an add some rebates to improve the aesthetics of our flange.

Again using the offset and power trim tool make some pockets to machine away.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2032.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2033.png)

There is some creative freedom here so use your imagination to come up with a unique design.

Just keep in consideration the diameter of the cutting tool that will need to be use for machining.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2034.png)

This area here will pose a significant problem, so it is best we address this now, not when the part is trying to be made.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2035.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2036.png)

Extrude cut → Fillet

![Untitled](L2%20-%20Flange%203d%20fc96f6782cbc4469bb657b2250b9ae05/Untitled%2037.png)

We now have a base 3d model that we can CNC machine from.

At this stage I would 3d print and test fit the flange and dummy onto the motor to ensure all dimensions were correct.
