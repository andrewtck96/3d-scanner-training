# Tools of the Trade

So when we consider measurement, what are the tools that we have that we can measure with.

Now, one thing that people jump quite quickly to is 3d scanning they go I need a $15,000 3d scanner to be able to do the things that you see others doing so well, it's not as complex as that needs to be. We still have a lot of tools available to us in a basic workshop. So we, if you just have a standard 2d scanner on the top of your printer. You now have the ability to record information from rubbings of your, of your manifolds and flanges. We can use cardboard mock ups, make up some patterns, and then flatten them out and then scan them as well. Even if you have to cut them into sections and scan them bit by bit, I would suggest looking at a 3d scanner, if you're going to do more and more of the stuff. And really the cost of a scanner. This day and age, you could buy one from your local, I guess, Walmart, or we call the warehouse, from $99.

But one thing that you cannot look past is the value of a good pair of vernier calipers. I run a pair of digital ones, or their mediterranea and brand, but even, even a cheap here can set you back, maybe 30 or $40, and that would be good.

So these are the tools that we're going to use to measure the information that we want to record. The next thing we're going to need, or next tool that we need is a good laptop. Now, or a laptop or a computer.

This day and age of pretty basic game computer is more than capable of running modern CAD software.

There's a little bit of a misconception that you need the fastest and grantees thing right out no

But that's not true. If you think about it, you could probably use a version of 2012 solid works on a older laptop now and all function completely fine.

The same is true with Fusion 360 Unfortunately, as it has constantly updated, but they are refining the software, ongoing, and it works quite well. There are some hiccups down again but that's true of any CAD software.

So we've got our laptop, we've got us software that we're going to use.

So for the duration of this course, I'll be showing the examples, and Solidworks.

Just as something I've been feeling as something I'm very familiar with. I've been using it for 17 years now, and not pretty well inside and out.

The process does not differ very much if you use a competitive software such as fusion 360 We just need to find the name of its tools that they use, so an extrusion was still an extrusion 2d sketching tool 2d sketching, bringing in your image of your scan into your 2d sketch will be a very similar process, scaling it so that it's correct, will be a very similar process, it's just something that we need to review and through the series of this course, I'm going to take time and show how to do that in Fusion 360, as well as SolidWorks.

The next most critical piece of this journey, or with our tools in our arsenal that we have in our workshop is prototyping, so we need an ability to produce a prototype for marking up so that we know that information was produced in our CAD software is correct, and it will fit. So even just going back to that printer. The amount of times I've just printed the flange that I've just drawn, cut it out manually and ensure that it fits correctly is so so often. Now the other thing that is going to be worthwhile in your arsenal, and something that we will cover in depth on this course is a 3d printer. Now 3d printing has gone from doing toys and trinkets to the majority of the components that I've produced that have actually been functional off a 3d printer in a garage workshop is vast. The majority of the products that you might see or projects on my Instagram page, have been produced in a small workshop, no bigger than 12 meter squared. Utilizing basic, basic desktop 3d printers. Now some of the material that I've used and selected and the processes that I've selected and used are more complex than what you'll often find, but that is why you're on this course I'm going to show you why. I use them and how I use them and how you can benefit from them.

Lastly, we're going to look at manufacturing so what tools are available to us within our close manufacturing space. So most people live quite close to a local industrial area, it would be good to review the companies and even just visit a few that have that do maybe a machine shop profile cutter, CNC routing company, laser cutters, sheet metal fabricators, you'll be interested and often surprised at the tools that they have and the willingness, they have to help you on a small scale, doing small projects of interest. So most of the time these workshops will be doing constant production work, and the opportunity to do an interesting smaller project, such as what we're going to do today. They will often take them on.

Just to view as a bit of variety to their day to day.

One thing that we also will go into is the capabilities of 3d metal printing, and we will also review and go through the process of investment casting plastic 3d prints, so that you have a very strong tool in your arsenal.

To be able to produce functional engine components that work using very low cost technology.

I look forward to going through this all with you, and, Yeah, let's get stuck in.
