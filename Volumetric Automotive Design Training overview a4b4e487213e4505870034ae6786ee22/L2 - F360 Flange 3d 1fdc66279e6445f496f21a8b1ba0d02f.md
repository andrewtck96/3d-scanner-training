In this lesson we are going to cement some of the skills we learnt in lesson 1, along with adding a bit of flavour to our flange.

As with before, create a new component, then Insert →Canvas our second lesson sketch.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled.png)

Again select the TOP (XY) Plane

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%201.png)

As with before our Canvas has come in out of position relative to our modeling environment.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%202.png)

Rotate this 90 degrees so that it is orientated relative to our Origin.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%203.png)

Click OK

Go to BROWSER, expand out the Canvases folder and right click on the Canvas we have just imported.

Select, Calibrate.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%204.png)

Zoom in and select the start of our overall Dimension line.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%205.png)

Select the other End and the dimension dialog box should appear.

Enter the Dimension to match the distance that you have selected.

**NOTE: Fusion 360 sometimes has little quirks, during the production of this training lesson, I was unable to use the calibrate tool on the 359 dimension. This is the preferred dimension to use as you will have the smallest amount of error when scaling.**

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%206.png)

Right click edit Canvas and reposition your scaled trace template to the origin.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%207.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%208.png)

Click OK 

Create a Sketch on the TOP (XY) Plane.

As we did in Lesson 1, go through and capture the hole positions of 2 points on our flange using the 3 point circle tool to rotationally align our Canvas.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%209.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2010.png)

Draw a centre line between our 2 hole positions and a Horizontal line.

Using the dimension tool measure the angle between them and record this.

This time we need to rotate the Canvas 0.315 Degrees counter clockwise.

Edit out Canvas → Rotate → Position over origin 

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2011.png)

Hide our construction sketch and create a new sketch on the TOP (XY) Plane.

We can now see when we start creating 3 point circles for our hole positions we see our right hand hole position is in line.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2012.png)

Capture all the hole positions of our flange using 3 point circles.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2013.png)

This time we are going to do something a bit different, and capture each set of features in their own sketches.

So close our Sketch and create a new one in the Top Plane.

When you sketch has opened, click Create → Slot → Overall Slot

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2014.png)

You will notice a lot of the tools we are using are based on finding the edges of features. 

This is opposite to how traditional CAD modelling is taught with setting the centre of a feature and dimensioning it. We are instead capturing the dimension, then positioning it.

Select as close as you can, the centre/edge of one side of the slot.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2015.png)

Move to the left-hand side, and do the same there.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2016.png)

Move the Cursor up until you get the desired slot shape and do the third click.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2017.png)

If your result is wildly out of position like below.

Do not stress, just complete the slot.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2018.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2019.png)

Then select one of the 2 circle centre points and drag your slot into position.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2020.png)

We are now going to copy our slot over to the other 3 ports.

Click modify → Move/Copy

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2021.png)

Click and Drag a box over all the geometry we wish to Copy

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2022.png)

Once we let go of the mouse cursor, the geometry will be blue and the Move/Copy tool remains ready for us to position our next slot.

BEFORE we move any positional arrows, we need to click “Create Copy”
Once we start to move the geometry we cannot turn this on.

If it becomes greyed out, or you move geometry without copying it, cancel the operation and start again. 

If the slot has moved to a new location that you do not want, press CTRL + Z, or press the Undo button at the top right of the screen.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2023.png)

Position you second slot, then click “OK”

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2024.png)

Repeat the operation 2 more times for the other 2 slots.

We now have our 4 exhaust ports.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2025.png)

Close our sketch.

Create a new one, and put it on that Top plane. (you will see a theme here)

In our new sketch, we are going to project over our geometry we just created.
We are doing this so that we can create the outline shame for our flange, without accidently modifying or deleting out base geometry when it comes time to trimming up a outer profile.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2026.png)

Select the Geometry and select OK

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2027.png)

Hide our base sketches by clicking the ‘eye’ next to them.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2028.png)

Now select the offset tool.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2029.png)

Then pick one of our projected geometries.

Pull the arrow lever down until we reach the desired offset for the geometry.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2030.png)

I put a Value of 7mm Offset for the hole positions and 11 for the exhaust ports.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2031.png)

We are now going to go and turn all of our projected geometry into construction Geo.

Do this by selecting it and clicking the “construction lines’ icon in the Dialog window on the right.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2032.png)

Once completed your projected geo should be dotted.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2033.png)

Now we are going to join up our geometry to get our profile

Next we are going to draw lines to join our geometry bodies so that we can create our flange outline.

This is where a bit of creative flare can come in.

For this example we are going to be boring, and just connect the offsets with straight lines.

Select the line too and connect all the closest hole offsets.
Do not worry about the mess we are going to make during this phase as we will be tidying it up with the trim function after.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2034.png)

For ease of drawing when in the line tool you can put your mouse cursor over the circle centre.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2035.png)

As you move your cursor upwards you will see a dotted line extend from the circle centre.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2036.png)

Move upwards until you reach the circle edge and select the start of the line.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2037.png)

This is a quick easy way to ‘cheat’ relationships into your sketches.

Go through and connect it all up.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2038.png)

We now have our base outline ready for trimming.

Select the trim tool.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2039.png)

Now start clicking on all the geometry pieces we do not wish to keep

If you select a piece of geometry you did not wish to trim away, just press escape and hit CTRL + Z or Undo.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2040.png)

We now have our outline we are ready to extrude.

Finish the Sketch.

Select Pull/Push and pull out sketch up 12mm

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2041.png)

As I do with my solidworks examples, I do all Filleting as finish/semi finishing operations to our parts rather than doing them at the sketch stage.

This way we can get an associative relationship between all fillet entities allowing us to modify all of them at the same time when we wish to make a dimensional change.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2042.png)

I have just hidden the Canvas to show our new flange body.

Next select the fillet tool 

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2043.png)

Once active, go through and select all the creases in our flange we wish to smooth out.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2044.png)

Pull the arrow until you get a result that suites the manufacturing method used to make the flange.

If we are laser cutting, the tightest radius tends to be 3 - 4mm in 12mm material.
For CNC Milling we would expect a 3.5mm radii to be the smallest we can do (using a 6mm End Mill)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2045.png)

We now have our smoothed out flange outline.

Next we want to extrude our exhaust ports.

Unhide our port sketches → Push/Pull → select port geometry and extrude cut through our flange.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2046.png)

Take note that I have orientated my view from the bottom of the model look up.

As we Push/Pull through the part we can see that it has changed to extrude cut.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2047.png)

Select OK to execute.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2048.png)

Repeat the process for our Hole positions.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2049.png)

No our main geometry is completed.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2050.png)

It is time to pocket out our exhaust holes for schedule pipe fitment.

For this we will be using 48.30mm Schedule 40 pipe.

Select the top face → create sketch

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2051.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2052.png)

Create a construction line from the centre point of each arc of our exhaust ports.

Select the line tool and hover the mouse cursor over the approximate centre of the arc.
A blue circle will appear. 

Left click on this point and start a line.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2053.png)

Move the cursor to the right and wait for Fusion to toggle on the centre point of the second arc.

Left Click on the circle when it appears.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2054.png)

Once completed press escape → select the created line → convert to Construction line

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2055.png)

repeat this process for the other 3 ports.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2056.png)

Now we are going to create a centre point circle by picking the middle of this line on the first port

Select the circle tool, then over the cursor over the centre of the construction line we have created until a blue X appears and the cursor toggles to it.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2057.png)

Left click and create an oversized circle.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2058.png)

We will add dimensions to this soon, but first, repeat the same process 3 more times on the other ports.

Don’t worry if they are different sizes.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2059.png)

Next select the equal relationship from the relationship tool bar.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2060.png)

Once activated, create equal relation ships with all the circles.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2061.png)

Alternatively you can select all 4 circles first and press the Equal relationship button to apply this to them at the same time.

Now we will dimension the first port 48.30mm, but in the measurement window we are going to put the notation “+0.6”

The 0.60mm is what we will use as tolerance to account for any inconsistency in the steam pipe we may find.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2062.png)

Press Enter and it will apply this dimension to all 4 circles at the same time.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2063.png)

Finish the Sketch.

Now Push/Pull these 3mm into the flange face.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2064.png)

We now have our port pockets for our steam pipe.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2065.png)

We are getting quite a good looking part, but we are not finished yet.

Now we want to pocket out the area between ports to give us an aesthetically pleasing looking part.

Select the top face and create a sketch.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2066.png)

Use the offset to apply a 12mm offset to all the geometry features of our flange.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2067.png)

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2068.png)

For the upper bolt positions we are going to increase the offset to 13mm

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2069.png)

This is so we get overlap that we can trim back to and fillet when it come to product our pocket.

Select the lower and upper edges and offset these 12mm so that a line is created that intersects the Steam pipe port offset circles.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2070.png)

Now usually in CAD software we would spend a lot of time trimming and cleaning up our geometry.

But Fusion allows us to extrude using regions.

So we are going to close our sketch → select the Push/Pull Tool and select the regions as shown below in blue.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2071.png)

Extrude these down 3mm

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2072.png)

Looking good, but we need to tidy up the inside of these pockets we have just created.

Select the fillet tool → Pocket intersections.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2073.png)

Apply a 3mm fillet to these.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2074.png)

The final touch of our part.

Add a chamfer to all of our edges.

Press the modify button → Chamfer

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2075.png)

Instead of spending our time selecting all the edges of our model we wish to chamfer.

We are just going to select the top face and apply a chamfer to it.

![Untitled](L2%20-%20F360%20Flange%203d%201fdc66279e6445f496f21a8b1ba0d02f/Untitled%2076.png)
