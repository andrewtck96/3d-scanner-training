Firstly, what is the design process? What are we trying to achieve? 

We have an idea in our head of what we're trying to make. Whether it be a new exhaust for our car, a new intake, a sump pan, so we can put the engine in a chassis that doesn't belong in gearbox bracket, law control arms, all sorts. So we have an idea of what we want to achieve. 

There's a problem that we're trying to solve, be that problem be more power, or something more aesthetic, or even just trying to get something to work. So the first part of this is that we have to look at what is the process of what we're doing. 

We need to do is plan; 

- what are we wanting to achieve?
- What method are we going to use to make it?
- What is our budget?

Now instinctually, we will have a plan, we will look at something and go, I really wish that exhaust manifold flowed better than it does. I want to make that better. So we need a plan that also incorporates the final result. So how are we going to make that? 

So if we, in our planning stage, we want to make a new exhaust manifold for a turbo engine? We need to go Okay, what method Are we going to use to make it? So one thing that we can consider is what's available to us. 

If we already know how to weld, and we need to be able to cut our own flanges, so that we can then produce a metaphor, we need to be able to find someone that can do that laser cutting for us. And we need to provide them the information and the format that they can use to do the cutting so but that the strategy for that will be much different than if the final outcome was to investment cast exhaust turbo manifold using a 3d print, the process will be much different. 

The planning stage of this needs to take that into consideration, because we have to think about what how much do we need to record or measure to be able to do what we want to do. If we're going to make a fabricator manifold, we would often need to only measure the two flange faces. So the flange on the engine and the flange on the turbocharger, the then we can get those laser cut and mock them into our engine bay, and use stays out of angle iron and weld them in position and know exactly where it wants to be. Now, if our end result was to investment cast the manifold using a 3d print, we would need to be able to recall that information beforehand. So that gets into our CAD software so that we knows where the turbo position can be relative to the engine so that we can actually draw it all inside our software. Now this is where the next stage of our design process is measurement. So what how are we going to measure what we've got available to us. So often, 3d scanning gets used quite a bit. It's one of the things that I'm quite reliant on. And I have used a lot in my processes and developing parts. It is definitely one of the easiest methods to do, but it's quite hard to understand. To to understand, to 3d printing, 3d printing, 3d scanning is quite a complex process to understand. And part of this course later on, we're going to go through how that process works. But when it comes to what we're doing at this stage,

What I would like to be able to give you is the tools to get going straight away.

So that you can start drawing and producing parts that you want and get them produced and made at the end of this lesson pretty much after that the next stage after our measurement is designed so we're going to take all the information that we've gathered, and we're going to put this into our CAD software of choice. Now for the ease of this course. I will be using SolidWorks because It is something I'm quite familiar with. However, the process will not differ that much if you choose to use any other form of software of this caliber. So the we have fusion 360, we have creo, we also have many others that are affordable. And these are all available to you that you can utilize. So, we're going to go through in this course, and look at the process of taking the measurement information, putting it into our CAD software, designing around that information, producing a prototype so that we can check and make sure that our design actually functions and fits. We're going to then take our prototype, and we're going to review it, maybe we need to redesign some features, then we're going to take the information that we have produced and our CAD software and we're going to manufacture our final part. We ourselves may not manufacture it and in house, we this might be utilizing a local machine shop to machine a billet part for you. This might be using a local laser cutter or profile cutter and maybe using a foundry to produce a casting for us. Or it may even be using a high value, middle 3d printing facility. But we can't think of the design process is just finishing our produced part. Sometimes we'll get a part back, put it into use and realize how we can refine this. Sometimes the designer is not as clear as it seems. I mean, SpaceX have launched by starship 15 times, exploding quite a few of them, and they still haven't finished yet. So we can assume that when we've gone through our process that we get to the end of it and go, that's magic. It's perfect. So we're going to review that when we get to the end of it.
